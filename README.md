# Assign4_MohanPan_DoaaIdris

Done By: Mohan Pan And Doaa Idris

Based on tutorial 6, we drew out a final prototype then got core features: muti-touch drawing, shape drawings, clear the screen, eraser, undo last stroke done.

We chosed lines, rectangle and circle as our three out of four shape drawing choices.

We chosed "Implement a nice colour picker" as our additonal feature. This color picker will pop up whn the user click on the square to the right of the toolbar, and it will update the stroke color accordingly
