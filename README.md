# Assign4_MohanPan_DoaaIdris

Based on tutorial 6, we drew out a final prototype then got core features: muti-touch drawing, shape drawings, clear the screen, eraser, undo last stroke done.

We chosed lines, rectangle and circle as our three out of four shape drawing choices.

We chosed "Implement a nice colour picker" as our additonal feature.
